# wit-bindgen-cs

This is the start of C# bindings for [wit](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit).

This is a project started at "Componentize The World" – a hackathon hosted by the Bytecode Alliance.

## Plan

(1) Bring in tests for wit-bindgen,
(2) Manually generate C# bindings to get a feel for things, and
(3) Try to generate these bindings automatically.

We can do the following in order:
(1) empty.wit
(2) integers.wit
(3) floats.wit
(4) strings.wit
(5) variants.wit
(6) simple-lists.wit
(7) records.wit
(8) option-result.wit
(9) keywords.wit
